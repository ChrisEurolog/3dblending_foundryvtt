Workflow and process to take high poly models from MeshyAI and make them ready for use in Foundry VTT Pathfinder 2e Game System in conjunction with the 3D Canvas module by theRipper93
# ChrisEurolog 3D Asset Pipeline for Foundry VTT

Automated processing scripts for converting Meshy AI outputs into production-ready 3D tokens for Pathfinder 2e and other Game Systems.

## 🚀 Pipeline Features
- **Voxel Hardening**: Prevents shattering on thin geometry (hair/ears).
- **Smart Decimation**: Balances high-fidelity visuals with VTT performance.
- **Dual Tracks**: Personal (Draco High-Poly) and Production (Meshopt Optimized).
